      <description>&lt;p&gt;Building a resume is more than just listing skills and experiences. It’s about &lt;strong&gt;telling your story&lt;/strong&gt;—reflecting not only where you’ve been but where you’re going. Over the years, I’ve developed an approach to crafting resumes that balance academic achievements, professional experiences, and leadership roles. Now, as the newly elected &lt;strong&gt;Professional Development Officer&lt;/strong&gt;, I’m excited to begin leading initiatives that will help others refine their resumes, identify their strengths, and position themselves for success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
