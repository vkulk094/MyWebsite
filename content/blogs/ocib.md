Presenting at the **Ottawa Biology Symposium 2024** was one of the most rewarding and enlightening experiences in my academic journey. The symposium gathered experts and students from various biological fields, giving me the opportunity to showcase my research on histone modifications in goldfish under hypoxic conditions.

## Preparation: Balancing Research and Presentation
As the symposium date approached, I spent weeks balancing the completion of my research with preparing my presentation. The challenge was not only in summarizing months of research into a concise presentation but also in ensuring that the technical aspects of my project were accessible to a broader audience.

One of the key lessons I learned during this process was the importance of **simplifying complex topics** without losing the essence of the research. I had to communicate the significance of histone modifications and their role in hypoxia tolerance in a way that resonated with both experts and those unfamiliar with the field.

## The Presentation: Managing Nerves and Engaging the Audience
On the day of the symposium, I was excited yet nervous. Standing in front of an audience filled with experienced researchers and fellow students, I initially felt the pressure. However, as I began to speak, I quickly realized that the key to managing nerves is to **focus on the content** and the **value it brings to the audience**.

Engaging with the audience through questions and interactive discussions helped create a dynamic and insightful exchange of ideas. I was able to share my findings while also receiving valuable feedback from researchers in related fields. This made the experience incredibly enriching.

## Key Takeaways: Growth Through Feedback
Receiving feedback from experienced researchers was invaluable. They pointed out areas for improvement in my study and even suggested new angles to explore in future research. The feedback I received has inspired me to further refine my techniques and dive deeper into the field of bioinformatics and epigenetics.

Overall, presenting at the Ottawa Biology Symposium taught me not only how to communicate scientific research effectively but also the importance of continuous learning through collaboration and feedback.

## Conclusion
This symposium was an eye-opening experience that deepened my passion for biological research. It reinforced my belief that science thrives when knowledge is shared, discussed, and questioned. I look forward to applying these lessons to future research endeavors and continuing to participate in academic conferences.
