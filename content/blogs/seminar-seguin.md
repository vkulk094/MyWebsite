On **October 31, 2024**, we were honored to welcome **Dr. Armand Séguin**, a Research Scientist from the Canadian Forest Service, who shared his cutting-edge research on **rapid testing methods for detecting ash tree infestation by the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB)**. This invasive insect, known for decimating North American ash tree populations, poses a significant threat to biodiversity and urban forestry.

## Key Takeaways from the Seminar
**A Practical Solution for Ash Infestation Detection**:
   - Dr. Séguin discussed a **rapid test for EAB infestation** inspired by quick COVID tests, emphasizing its **potential for fast and accurate results**. This tool aims to streamline the identification process, enabling early intervention before extensive damage occurs.
   - The test incorporates **nanotechnology and miniaturized tech**, allowing for easier sample collection and processing. As Dr. Séguin noted, this approach makes it possible for the public to participate, adding an **educational and community engagement aspect**.

**The Threat of Emerald Ash Borer to Urban and Indigenous Forests**:
   - EAB, primarily detected in **southern Ontario** since 2002, has spread extensively across eastern Canada and the U.S. The insect feeds on tree leaves and larvae tunnel into tree trunks, weakening the trees. In urban areas like Ottawa, **ash trees marked for removal** can often be seen due to the infestation.
   - The loss of ash trees affects **Indigenous communities** who rely on ash wood for cultural practices like basket weaving, underscoring the social impact of this environmental issue.

## Conservation, Technology, and Socio-Ecological Impact
A significant aspect of Dr. Séguin’s research involves balancing conservation needs with **advances in technology and understanding socio-ecological impact**:
   - Ash trees, valuable for **carbon sequestration** in urban forests, are vital to ecological health.
   - The Canadian Forest Service is collaborating with banks and other organizations to **prioritize conservation efforts** in urban areas where these trees contribute significantly to reducing urban pollution.

Dr. Séguin also emphasized the potential of **genomic sequencing** to enhance conservation efforts. Notably, the **EAB genome and the ash tree’s genome** have been sequenced, offering insights into tree defenses and potential paths for breeding EAB-resistant ash trees.

## Professional Development Interview: Insights from Dr. Armand Séguin

After the seminar, I had the opportunity to sit down with **Dr. Armand Séguin** for a brief interview focusing on his career journey, his views on emerging technologies, and advice for those aspiring to make an impact in environmental research.

### Q1: What key decisions or skills were instrumental in shaping your career within the Canadian Forest Service?

Dr. Séguin highlighted the importance of **timing and strategic planning**, including financial strategies, in his career. He emphasized that **scientists should be meticulous but open-minded**, advising that research shouldn’t be limited to familiar methods. “Experiment with all approaches available,” he advised, sharing that he encourages students in his lab to explore various techniques and solutions. "It’s in my budget," he remarked, underscoring his belief in **risk-taking** and thoroughness. His approach is to always consider the broader perspective as well as the finer details, emphasizing how both aspects are interconnected.

### Q2: Given your work on rapid detection methods, what emerging technologies do you believe will be transformative in the coming years? And how should young researchers leverage them?

Dr. Séguin pointed to **nanotechnology and miniaturized diagnostic tools** as key innovations that will transform detection methods. “Think of it like the COVID-19 tests,” he explained, describing how **smaller, faster tests** could simplify processes and make science accessible and engaging to the public. He encouraged young researchers to leverage these technologies by taking advantage of their **speed, simplicity, and outreach potential**, highlighting that they can make complex science feel like a “fun little science experiment” that bridges communities with the scientific process.

### Q3: What advice would you give to someone starting out in environmental research, particularly for making an impact in government research roles?

With a smile, Dr. Séguin exclaimed, **“Read the newspaper!”** He stressed the importance of staying informed about current events and policy as environmental science is highly responsive to societal needs. **Understanding policy aspects** of media coverage, he said, provides researchers with a pulse on the issues that science is continually called upon to address, such as climate change adaptation strategies that must balance environmental protection with practical business continuity. This advice underscores the critical link between scientific research and societal relevance, a perspective he sees as essential for impactful careers in government research.

## Research Highlights
- **Chinese Ash Trees’ Natural Resistance**: Dr. Séguin noted that while North American ash species lack resistance to EAB, **Chinese ash trees** display natural resilience, possibly due to co-evolution with the pest.
- **Defense Mechanisms**: His research identified specific **defense enzymes** activated in ash trees during EAB infestation. The findings are crucial for developing diagnostic tests to detect infestation levels early.

## Socio-Ecological Context
Dr. Séguin’s work is not only a scientific pursuit but also a **societal endeavor**. The EAB crisis impacts **urban landscapes, Indigenous cultural practices, and local economies**, making it essential to develop proactive, culturally informed conservation strategies.

## Looking Ahead
Dr. Séguin envisions a future where **scientific research incorporates public engagement** to help foster awareness and community participation. For aspiring researchers, he emphasized the importance of diversifying skills, staying engaged with current events, and **thinking beyond the lab to make a real-world impact**.
