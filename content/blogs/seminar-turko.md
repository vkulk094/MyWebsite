---

On **November 21, 2024**, Dr. Andy Turko from the University of Guelph delivered an insightful seminar hosted by Dr. Emily Standen, titled **“Interactions between physiological plasticity and habitat choice in changing environments.”** Dr. Turko, who transitioned from graduate student to faculty member at the University of Guelph (despite leaving Guelph three times during his academic journey), presented fascinating research that bridges physiology, evolution, and environmental adaptation.

## Key Takeaways from the Seminar

### **Phenotype-Environment Mismatches**  
Dr. Turko explored how animals navigate environmental changes, such as fluctuating water levels and seasonal variations, through the lens of **“Phenotype-Environment Mismatches.”** He emphasized two types of feedback loops:  
- **Negative Feedback**: Where animals avoid changes to their physiology.  
- **Positive Feedback**: Surprisingly more common, these loops drive further physiological adaptation, reinforcing habitat shifts.

## Part I: Amphibious Fish – Engineers of Adaptation  
Dr. Turko’s research on amphibious fish highlighted their incredible ability to survive on both land and water. During his PhD, he investigated how these fish cope with the increased body weight on land compared to water, studying gill mechanics and bone structure.

### Gill Adaptations in Air vs. Water  
Using cutting-edge techniques, including proteomics and fluorescent dyes like **Calcene** and **Alican Blue**, Dr. Turko made serendipitous discoveries:  
- **Gill Bone Stiffness**: Air-dwelling fish have stiffer gill skeletons, possibly to maintain respiratory function on land.  
- **Calcification**: Air fish exhibited higher calcium levels in their gills, suggesting independent evolution of land-adaptive traits in killifish over ten separate times.  

### Engineering Insights  
- The **“Resilience Ratio”** (elastic torque/capillary torque) demonstrated that collapse-resistant gills might help amphibious species endure hypoxic conditions.  
- In synthetic models, grouping lamellae increased surface area, but further in vivo studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.  

### Hypoxia and Positive Feedback  
When faced with hypoxia, amphibious fish exhibit hyperventilation and **gill remodeling**. This positive feedback reinforces their preference for land as hypoxic water pushes them to adapt further for terrestrial survival.

## Part II: Thermal Physiology in Endangered Stream Fish  
Dr. Turko shifted focus to thermal physiology in stream fish, which endure significant temperature variations in their habitats (16.4°C to 29.7°C).  

### Aerobic Scope and Juvenile Behavior  
Using thermal gradient arenas and tracking systems, he investigated the **aerobic scope** (a measure of metabolic performance) in juveniles versus adults. Contrary to expectations, juvenile fish exhibited unexpected aerobic scope trends. Dr. Turko proposed two possible explanations:  
1. **Parental Guidance**: Juveniles may learn behaviors by following adults.  
2. **Physiological Optimization**: Juveniles take time to fully adapt to environmental demands.

## Key Conclusions from the Seminar  
1. **Animals Have Agency**: Dr. Turko highlighted the active role of animals in shaping their evolutionary trajectories.  
2. **Evolutionary Impacts of Agency**: This agency influences how species adapt to changing environments, with wide-ranging consequences for global biodiversity.
